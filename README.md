This repository demonstrates a common SQL error where using `LIMIT 1` in a subquery leads to incomplete data retrieval if multiple records match the subquery's criteria. The `bug.sql` file contains the erroneous query, while `bugSolution.sql` provides the corrected version.  The issue occurs when the subquery returns more than one row, and `LIMIT 1` selects only a single, arbitrary result. The solution involves using `IN` or `EXISTS` for more reliable and complete data retrieval.
